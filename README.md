# auto-doc-flask-restful

This is an attempt to find the best way on how to auto document a flask restful API.

I'm going to be using different methods which will be divided in different folders:

*[Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/)

*[Swagger](https://helloreverb.com/developers/swagger)

*[flask-autodoc](https://github.com/acoomans/flask-autodoc)
